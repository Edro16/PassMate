# PassMate

PassMate is a program that generates random passwords for you.

You can choose to generate either regular passwords or passphrases, and specify how many you want.

For regular passwords, you can set the number of characters and choose whether to include letters, numbers, and symbols.

For passphrases, you can set the number of words and choose a separator (the character that separates each word).
